    <h2 class="title">How to differentiate a BEM-block from a BEM-element</h2>

    <ul class="list">
        <li class="list__item">Just ask yourself the question: "This code part may be required to me
            separately, in itself? Or
            is it only necessary inside her parent?" If you need it separately, this is a BEM-block, if it is
            conceivable only inside the parent - it's a BEM-element.
        </li>

        <li class="list__item">In really doubtful cases, make a choice in favor of BEM-block.</li>

        <li class="list__item">Do not forget about mixing (it is possible to have at the same level a BEM-level
            class of
            some
            parent block, and its BEM-block level class).
